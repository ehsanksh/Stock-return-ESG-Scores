# Stock-return-ESG-Scores

	First we extract about 500 stock tickers/symbols in SP500 index (2009-2018 periodd).
	We directly imported the ESG data from WRDS website(2009-2018 periodd).
	We import the stock prices and other information from Yahoo Finance.
	We calculate stock returns, stock price crash, cumulative return and etc.
	We run two types of regressions/ classifications:
o	First we perform a cross sectional analysis and we investigate how average returns change across different stocks with different ESG profiles. 
o	Second we perform time series analysis using regressions and classifications for each stock to find out the relation between their ESG profile and stock return and stock price crash over a time period.
